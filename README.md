This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Ruby related to method and instance variable naming collisions.  The `bug.rb` file shows a scenario where attempting to set an instance variable through a method of the same name doesn't work as intended. The solution, shown in `bugSolution.rb`, demonstrates how to correctly define both getter and setter methods using the standard `attr_accessor` or by explicitly declaring both.
